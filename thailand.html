    <article class="readable-background">
      <p>Bangkok, Thailand’s capital city, is Saint’s hometown. A sprawling cosmopolitan city, you can get a taste of everything here -- from temples to thai massage, shopping to street food, floating markets to fine dining, night markets to nightlife. There are enough attractions to fill a few days (and many day trips you can take to cities outside of Bangkok), but we recommend spending even more time here if you’re a shopaholic. Bangkok is infamous for its traffic jams, so plan your daily itineraries carefully to minimize time spent getting around. We like to take the subway and skytrain when possible.</p>

      <h3>Must Do</h3>
      <ul class="readable-green-background">
        <li><strong>Thai Massage</strong> | Thai Massage parlours are everywhere, and a 60 minute massage usually costs less than $10USD. Walk-ins are welcome, though you can call and make an appointment in advance. 15% tip to the masseuse is appreciated.</li>
        <li><strong>Eat</strong> | All the foods! See all of our food recommendations <a class="big-link" href="food.html">here</a>.</li>

    <h3>Sightseeing</h3>
    <ul class="readable-background">
      <li><strong>Grand Palace & Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew), and Temple of Reclining Buddha (Wat Pho)</strong> | These are Bangkok’s must-see attractions. All three sites are located together. Be sure when visiting any royal site or temple to prepare for the strict dress code (no tank tops, and no shorts. As Nic has learned, leggings aren’t considered pants.)</li>
      <li><strong>Temple of the Golden Mountain</strong> | Climb up the steps, ring big metal bells, and check out the 360 degree view of bangkok from the “heaven” section at the top with a beautiful golden stupa. Great to get some morning exercise. Check out <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293916-d4404973-Reviews-Krua_Apsorn-Bangkok.html" target="_blank" class="big-link">Krua Apsorn</a> restaurant (michelin bib, closed on Sundays) that has great traditional thai dishes (Gang Som orange curry, Sator smelly green beans) as well as amazing coconut sorbet and Chao Guay (grass jelly).</li>
      <li><strong>Khlong Lat Mayom Floating Market</strong> | The bigger floating markets are located a few hours outside Bangkok, weekends only. Lots of local food like chicken/pork satay, steamed seafood, traditional desserts like Blaa Krim Kai Tao, coconut ice cream, Jub Liang (flower black herbal drink), Kraya Sat (dense thai rice crispy with nuts and sesame), there are also some fruits for sale here.</li>
      <li><strong>Koh Kred Island</strong> | Take a ferry to this island famous for traditional desserts. Walk along the walking street with dessert and food vendors on both sides. Try Thai fish cakes (Tod Mun Kala), mini young coconut pancakes (Khanom Babin), and chill at restaurants overlooking the water, checkout a pottery factory and a small temple as well. you can rent a bike and bike around the island but the walking street gets congested so you have to walk your bike for that part. Do not take the boat ride tour. Market only opens on weekends 9AM-4PM.</li>
      <li><strong>Chatuchak/Jatujak Market</strong> | Massive day outdoor market only open on weekends. Very tourist-friendly, but locals shop here too. They sell a little bit of everything. Check out Nic’s favorite section -- the exotic pets and animal section. Favorite dessert here is Tub Tim Grob (red ruby), crunchy water chestnuts in glutinous rice flour in coconut milk with ice (Section 26, in between Soi 1 & 2). There are also plenty of coconut ice creams and street food along the main walking street, and good open restaurants like boat noodles and papaya salad. People also sell tradition ice sticks (thai iced tea as well as soda flavors), look for a vendor shaking a large metal basin of ice.</li>

      <h3>Shopping</h3>
      <ul class="readable-green-background">
        <li><strong>Pratunam Platinum</strong> | A shopper’s paradise, best for women’s apparel. Great food court on the top floor. Most shops are open between 12-5pm.</li>
        <li><strong>MBK (Maboonkrong)</strong> | A gadget geek’s paradise, best for electronics, has one of the best food courts, and a lot of souvenirs (snacks, dried fruits, funny t-shirts).</li>
        <li><strong>Siam Square</strong> | The shopping center of the city, with many high-end shopping destinations (e.g. Siam Paragon) interspersed with local shopping and great food at restaurants and in mall food courts.</li>
        <li><strong>Union Mall</strong> | Locals’ favorite, many clothing shops (cheap suits and dresses), fun dress shirts and shorts, and food outlets (upstairs, boat noodles, e-san north eastern food) and food court in the basement. Check out Napalai thai massage (Zone F3). Take MRT subway to Phahon Yothin (Exit 5). This is one stop away from Chatuchak Market. Most shops are open between 11-8pm. Across the street is another mall Central Plaza Ladprao (good food court in the basement and shops), upper floors of this mall are brand name shops.</li>

      <h3>Eating</h3>
      <ul class="readable-background">

Eat Leng Saab (Boiled Pig Spine With Hot & Spicy Soup, lots of lime and green chili, eat with your hands) and then find coconut ice cream to cool you down, buy cool t-shirts at House of Tee.</li>

      <h3>Nature & City</h3>
      <p>Take a short 1-hour flight to the north of Thailand to take a break from the frenetic pace of Bangkok. We love the North for waterfall-filled hiking, hanging with elephants, relaxing in the mountains, wandering the night markets, and enjoying northern Thai cuisine.</p>
      <h3>Chiang Mai</h3>

The temple sits atop a staircase of 300 steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Elephant Nature Park</strong> | The <a href="https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/" class="big-link" target="_blank">Elephant Nature Park</a> is a sanctuary that rescues and rehabilitates elephants. You can spend a day there learning about, feeding, and even bathing elephants!</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Markets</strong> | We love wandering the fresh markets in the daytime. There are so many new snacks, fruits, and dishes to try! The morning is when there will be the most action. Check out <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Qvr8DyG9KbL2" class="big-link" target="_blank">Talad Warorot</a> (ตลาดวโรรส กาดหลวง) and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Eh6dG1sQ95U2" class="big-link" target="_blank">Talad Muangmai</a> (ตลาดเมืองใหม่)</li>
        <li><strong>Night Markets</strong> | Night markets are where the locals hang out in the evenings, and always offer a mix of street shopping and awesome food. Check out <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2uKrJTw9XGu" class="big-link" target="_blank">Talad Wualai</a> (ตลาดวัวลาย) on Saturdays 5-10pm, or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/9AG3xmimRAx" class="big-link" target="_blank">Talad Tarpae</a> (ตลาดท่าแพ) on Sundays 5-10pm.</li>
        <li><strong>Eat</strong> | Khao soi (coconut curry chicken noodle soup) is a must in the North; <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293917-d3179026-Reviews-Khao_Soi_Lam_Duan_Fa_Ham-Chiang_Mai.html" target="_blank" class="big-link">Khao Soi Lam Duan</a> is one of the best.</li>

      <h3>Come for the Beaches!</h3>
      <p>Take a short 1.5 hour flight south to spend a few days on the beach, island-hopping, swimming in the ocean, and snorkeling amongst the reefs. All of these beach destinations offer full day boat tours to visit the vast archipelago of tiny islands surrounding them. We highly recommend these boat tours as a fun way to enjoy a variety of beaches and reefs. Private boat tours are worth it!</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phuket</strong> | Phuket (pronounced “pook-it”) is one of Thailand’s most popular beach destinations. Patong, the main resort town, is a popular (seedy) nightlife destination.</li>
        <li><strong>Krabi</strong> | Krabi (pronounced “grah-bee”) is another beach destination with close access to a variety of tiny islands, but less populous than Phuket. Popular islands to visit on boat tours include the the famous Koh Phi Phi (pronounced “pee-pee”), James Bond Island, and Koh Lanta.</li>
        <li><strong>Lipe</strong> | Lipe (pronounced “lee-bpay”) is the southernmost island in Thailand and known as the “Maldives of Thailand”. We consider Lipe more beautiful and less touristy than Phuket and Krabi, perhaps because it’s harder to get to, requiring a 2 hour flight from Bangkok to Hat Yai, a 2-hour bus ride, then a 1.5 ferry ride. Enjoy a full day private boat tour of the surrounding islands for $100.</li>
